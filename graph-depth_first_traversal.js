// Depth First Traversal in Graphs


// Depth first traversal goes as deep as possible in a graph, then backtracks until it finds a new path to explore.  It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit next.  

// Breadth first traversal goes through each level of a graph, starting at the root, before moving on to the next level.  It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.
